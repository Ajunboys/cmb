CMB VERSION 2.2.12
--------------------------------------------------------------------

New features and bug fixes:

- added support for Cassandra 1.1.X (note there are now different schema
  files for Cassandra 1.0.X and 1.1.X)
- cns worker to recreate cqs queues on the fly when needed
- centralized monitoring and management of cns workers through cns
  endpoint and admin UI  
- cns worker to cache cqs queue urls to ease load on cns api
- adjusted default size of key parameters for cns worker in 
  cmb.properties
- http default timeout of 5 sec for slow endpoints (can be adjusted
  in cmb.properties)
- bug fix: allow publishing of blank messages
- cns worker to temporarily suspend slow or failing endpoints if more 
  than n bad responses are encountered in a rolling window of 60 seconds   
  (threshold can be adjusted in cmb.properties)
- offer configurable white list of acceptable http return codes
  (such as 404 if desired)
- simple login and session management for admin ui to distinguish 
  admin and normal users (note: currently the only admin user is 
  the one configured as cmb.cns.user in cmb.properties, typically
  "cns_internal")
- various improvements for endpoint servlet (testing tool for cns)
  such as introducing a duplicate counter
